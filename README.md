# Axis Publisher
Getting event data payload from an ACAP can be a challange.  The common way is to connect to the VAPIX/ONVIF event stream which requires an RTSP stream with authentication.  Publish decouples the data producing device and push the data to a consuming services.  Publisher will send supported event payload to MQTT, Influx Database or a HTTP Server.  An optional JPEG image (upon event detection) may be included in the data payload.
