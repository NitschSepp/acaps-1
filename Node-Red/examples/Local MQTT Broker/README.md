# Local MQTT Broker

MQTT is a publish/subscribe protocol that simplifies a lot of system integration.  It has many benefits compared to alternetive protocols.  For MQTT to work you need to have a broker (server) that clients connects to.  The broker, typically Eclipse Mosquitto can be downloaded and installed from  https://mosquitto.org/.  A system may use brokers hosted in the cloud.
If you do not have a broker or a computer that can host a broker you can use Node-Red to install one in the camera.  This is also the fastes way if you want  sandbox environment to play around with MQTT.
